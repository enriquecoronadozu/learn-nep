 RIZE (Robot Interface from Zero Experience) is Google Blockly, form and web-based programming interface which can be used to work with heterogeneous and multi-robot systems. RIZE was designed to enable an easy addition of new robots, sensory devices and human behavior understanding algorithms.
The main idea of RIZE is reduce the effort that requires robot development for both end-users and expert programmers using form- and block-based enviroments and automatic code generation tools.</description>
